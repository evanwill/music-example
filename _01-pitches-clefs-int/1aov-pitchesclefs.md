title: 1a Overview - Pitches and Clefs
---

Most college music students are familiar with basic music notation -- treble and bass clefs, staves, ledger lines, and accidentals -- although they are usually far more comfortable when working in the clef most associated with their primary instrument or voice-part. It is vital that music students be fluent in not only these two most common clefs, but also with two additional clefs: alto clef and tenor clef. These clefs are commonly used for instruments such as viola, cell, trombone, and bassoon. Clefs are an essential way for a composer to communicate range, so it is imperative that you become as comfortable reading music in all of the most common clefs.

Alto and tenor clefs are called C-clefs, because of the shape used to denote each of the clefs. In the following examples for this topic, try to determine:
- the order of pitch names for each clef's lines and spaces
- why they are called C-clefs
- how these clefs relate spatially to treble and bass clefs
